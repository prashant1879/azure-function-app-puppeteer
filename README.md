# Azure Function App with Puppeteer

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Puppeteer, a Node library which provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol, within an Azure Functions app. Puppeteer allows for automated control over headless Chrome or Chromium instances, making it useful for tasks such as web scraping, automated testing, and generating screenshots.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- Azure Functions Core Tools (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/azure-functions-app-puppeteer.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd azure-functions-app-puppeteer
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the Azure Functions app locally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/screenshot?url=https://example.com` to trigger the function. Replace `https://example.com` with the URL you want to take a screenshot of.

## Configuration

You can configure the function's behavior by modifying the `function.json` file and the `index.js` file in the `Screenshot` directory. Ensure that you update the `bindings` section of the `function.json` file to match your desired trigger and input/output bindings.

## Deployment

To deploy this Azure Functions app to Azure, refer to the official Azure Functions documentation on deployment methods (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies).
